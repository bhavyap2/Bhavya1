-----------------------

firebase is like a database used to store the data receive the data update the data and delete the data.

1.HOW TO CREATE DATABADE IN FIREBASE

 -> Google->enter firebase.com ->go to Get started ->sign in with the google account
    ->new project ->add project-> enter the project name->continue ->after that in left side there is an database
    ->click on that->set database in default account firebase ->create database (click below the real time database)
    -> start in testmode->enable


2.after creating database, copy the link in firebase,paste into the service you created in angualr project,
 after that by using that link we can post the data,get the data ,update the data and delete the data.
 and also write the code for post(),get(),update() and delete() in service.

3.after that write a table in .html file to get the data in table format, and then take one variable like ('u' variable used in .html) put 
  it in the for loop to iterate array and also we mention in form tag like (ngSubmit) by using that we can post data,copy the method written in
 for (ngSubmit) and paste in .ts file write code for that method,subscribe that data then only it will work,before that we mension the service 
 in constructor which service we are using.

4.same thing to get method but get method should be called by constuctor in the .ts file 

5.for the update, take one modal in bootstrap copy code paste in .html file  after that in modal body again write form format 
  for update, if you need again the data whatever we entered in previous form to the model form,so take again one variable in .ts file, 
  assign  value for the variable by using which variable used in the for loop ,and then mention in if statement, to check codition after
  that mention [(ngModel)] for each input variable.
  

6. in the model again two buttons shold be there are update and delete,if you click on update button data is updated in database or if 
   you click on close model is closed in that data is remain same.

7.if you click delete button in table it goes to another model there is a message leke this "do you want to delete this one?" and
   below the text two buttons is there like delete and cancel,if you click on that delete button data is deleted in the database or 
   if you click on the cancel the model is closed without deleting the data.
